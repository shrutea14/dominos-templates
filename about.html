        <p>Domino’s came from humble beginnings in 1960, with just one store. Now, as the largest pizza company in the world, Domino’s proudly continues its legacy of delivering great-tasting pizza to customers’ doors..<br>
            Domino’s has a rich history of developing innovations that have made a significant impact on the pizza and delivery industries. Is Domino’s a pizza company with great technology, or are we a technology company that just happens to sell pizza? We’ll let you be the judge!</p>
        <p>Domino’s believes in giving back and helping those in times of need. We hope to spread long-lasting change and positivity through financial contributions, in-kind donations, and volunteerism.</p>
